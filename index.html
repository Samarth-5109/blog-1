    <h1>Volkswagen Diesel Gate Scandal</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Well, today we're going to be talking about one such car that perfectly exemplifies that it has been dubbed as a diesel dupe and when it came out it shocked millions of car owners across the globe. The Volkswagen emissions scandal, sometimes known as Dieselgateor Emissionsgate began in September 2015, when the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a notice of violation of the Clean Air Act to German automaker Volkswagen Group.</p>
        <p>Volkswagen came to the united states by October 1955 by 1970 Volkswagen had captured seven percent of the united states car mark the car company continued to develop and during the late 2010s Volkswagen had taken over the united state's passenger car diesel market accounting for roughly 70 of the cars in the market now Volkswagen promoted clean diesel in an effort to promote the environmentally-friendly vehicles.</p>

        <h2>The Defeat device</h2>

        <p> In 2005 Volkswagen rejected the idea to purchase the rights to Mercedes' bulky, expensive, high maintenance "Selective catalytic reduction," urea-based exhaust BlueTec treatment system for reducing diesel exhaust pollution. They preferred to develop their own inexpensive "lean NOx trap" system. Volkswagen management gave a go-ahead for their developed system but the system failed to combine good fuel economy with compliant NOx emissions. So they programmed their ECU in such a way that the software could sense test scenarios by monitoring speed, engine operation, air pressure, and even the position of the steering wheel. Therefore, the emissions were produced as high as over 40 times more pollution than the amount allowed by law and but comply with the US NOx standards when being tested, constituting a defeat device.

        <h2>Affected Cars</h2>

        <p>VW has had a major push to sell diesel cars in the US, backed by a huge marketing campaign trumpeting its cars' low emissions. The EPA's findings cover 482,000 cars in the US only, and the VW models Jetta, Beetle, Golf, and Passat. But VW has admitted that about 11 million cars worldwide, including eight million in Europe, are fitted with the so-called "defeat device".</p>
